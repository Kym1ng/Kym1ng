### Experience

ðŸ’» **Research Assistant**  
*USC INI (Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute)*  
Feb 2024 â€“ Jan 2025  
- Developed a DCN-GAN in PyTorch to generate cortex thickness meshes for data augmentation and Mesh Diffusion modeling, enhancing dataset diversity and training robustness.
- Designed and implemented the model with ResNet blocks and attention layers to improve depth and feature extraction, reducing FID score 41.52% mesh generation.
- Optimized and fine-tuned the model on GPU clusters using YAML-based configuration control with Omegaconf and implemented mesh visualization using SciPy for enhanced interpretability.
- Improved GAN stability by applying weight clipping for WGAN and gradient penalty loss (WGANGP), achieving balanced discriminator-generator convergence.
ðŸ’» **Software Engineering Intern**  
*Eth Tech*  
Nov 2023 â€“ Jan 2024  
- Implemented a distributed e-commerce database system using MongoDB with Amazon Fashion Products dataset and developed backend CRUD operations using Tkinter and PyMongo along with a Streamlit-based desktop query interface to enhance user experience.
- Optimized data distribution by designing an effective hash key for MongoDB sharding, educing query latency by 50% and improving data reliability through distributed backup strategies.
- Built a lightweight real-time database on AWS EC2, leveraging cURL to communicate via the REST API, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval for e-commerce interactions.
- Visualized overall transaction data using D3.js, React.js and Deck.gl, rendering interactive, map-based dashboards to reveal spatial distribution and transaction patterns.

ðŸ’» **Machine Learning Engineer Intern**  
*Yisen Tech*  
Aug 2023 â€“ Oct 2023  
- Developed a hybrid recommendation system for personalized user recommendations using Yelp rating data.
- Processed large-scale data using Spark RDD, optimizing feature extraction and transformation for efficiency.
- Improved item-based collaborative filtering by integrating an XGBoost-based model, incorporating key features, and validating their impact through RMSE analysis.
- Achieved 95.1% accuracy representing a 6% performance boost in comparison to the baseline.
