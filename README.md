### Experience

ðŸ’» **Research Assistant**  
*USC INI (Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute)*  
Feb 2024 â€“ Jan 2025  
- Developed a DCN-GAN in PyTorch to generate cortex thickness meshes for data augmentation and Mesh Diffusion modeling, enhancing dataset diversity and training robustness.
- Designed and implemented the model with ResNet blocks and attention layers to improve depth and feature extractionâ€”reducing the FID score by 41.52% for mesh generation.
- Optimized the model on GPU clusters using YAML-based configuration control with Omegaconf and implemented mesh visualization with SciPy for enhanced interpretability.
- Improved GAN stability by applying weight clipping for WGAN and gradient penalty loss (WGANGP), achieving balanced discriminator-generator convergence.

ðŸ’» **Software Engineering Intern**  
*Eth Tech*  
Nov 2023 â€“ Jan 2024  
- Implemented a distributed e-commerce database system using MongoDB with the Amazon Fashion Products dataset, developing backend CRUD operations with Tkinter and PyMongo.
- Created a Streamlit-based desktop query interface to enhance user experience.
- Optimized data distribution by designing an effective hash key for MongoDB sharding, reducing query latency by 50% and bolstering data reliability through distributed backup strategies.
- Built a lightweight real-time database on AWS EC2, leveraging cURL with the REST API for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Visualized transaction data using D3.js, Vue, and Deck.gl, creating interactive map-based dashboards to reveal spatial distribution and transaction patterns.

ðŸ’» **Machine Learning Engineer Intern**  
*Tencent Holdings Ltd.*  
Aug 2023 â€“ Oct 2023  
- Developed a hybrid recommendation system for personalized user recommendations using Yelp rating data.
- Processed large-scale data with Spark RDD, optimizing feature extraction and transformation for efficiency.
- Enhanced item-based collaborative filtering by integrating an XGBoost model, achieving 95.1% accuracyâ€”a 6% performance boost over the baseline.
